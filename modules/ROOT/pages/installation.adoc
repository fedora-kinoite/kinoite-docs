= Installing Kinoite

Fedora Kinoite can be installed in the same way as Fedora Workstation, and the
official Fedora installation guide can be followed for your Fedora version.
See the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/docs/[Fedora documentation site]
for more details.

[[before-you-begin]]
== Before you begin

As with installing any new operating system, it is important to back up any
data that you want to save before starting, and have a clear understanding of
the consequences of what you are doing.

Kinoite is intended to provide the full range of capabilities that you would
expect from an installation of Fedora Workstation. However, there are some
differences in terms of which applications can be installed, and how the
operating system environment works.

It is therefore recommended that you read this user guide before deciding to
install Kinoite. It is also recommended that you determine whether Kinoite
meets the specific needs or requirements that you might have. If you are
uncertain about this, Kinoite can also be tested in a virtual machine prior to
installation or booted from a flash drive using Fedora Media Writer.

[[known-limitations]]
== Known limitations

*Kinoite does not provide a fully functional experience for dual booting or
manual partitioning.*

It is possible to make Kinoite work for both dual boot and manual partitioning,
and some guidance is provided on manual partitioning below.  However, there are
hazards involved in both cases, and you should only attempt to use these
features if you have done the necessary research, and are confident that you
can overcome any issues that you might encounter.

[[getting-kinoite]]
== Getting Kinoite

If you are using Fedora Media Writer, Kinoite should be listed as a download
option. However, if it isn't, or if you want to download it manually, an
install image can be downloaded from https://kinoite.fedoraproject.org/[the
main Kinoite website].

Once you have got your copy of Kinoite, it can be installed in the usual
manner. We hope that you love it!

[[manual-partition]]
== Manual Partitioning

As described above, there are known issues with manual partitioning on Kinoite,
and it should be used with caution. The following notes are intended as hints
for those attempting it, and should not be treated as recommended practice.
	Automatic partitioning is recommended.

With Kinoite, only certain mounts can be manually specified as partitions.
These include:

* `/boot`
* `/var`
* Subdirectories under `/var`, including:
** `/var/home` (Kinoite has a symlink from `/home` to `/var/home`)
** `/var/log`
** `/var/containers`
* The root filesystem: `/`

The Fedora installer is not aware of these restrictions and will accept custom
partitions without error, even if they are incompatible with Kinoite.

The above screenshot shows a typical configuration with manual partitioning,
with partitions for `/boot`, `/`, `swap` and `/var/home`.

Manual partitioning on Kinoite can be done with `Btrfs`,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_%28Linux%29[LVM], as well
as standard partitions or an `xfs` filesystem.
